# Lab 10: Device Trees

## Overview
I edited the device tree to add a heartbeat LED.

## Deliverables
The purpose of device trees are to generalize the congfiguration of the hardware when a linux kernel boots on an embedded system. Device trees are a data structure to hold the hardware information that is passed to the operating system on boot.
