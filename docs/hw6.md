# HW6: Async Conditioner

## Overview
When using inputs for on an FPGA, several processing steps must be completed before the signal is ready to be incorporated into a design. The asynchronous conditioner syncrhonizes, debounces, and turn an input signal into a single pulse and is designed to be used for a push button input.
